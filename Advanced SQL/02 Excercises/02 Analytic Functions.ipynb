Towards this goal, you'd like to create a plot that shows a rolling average of the daily number of taxi trips.  Amend the (partial) query below to return a DataFrame with two columns:\n- `trip_date` - contains one entry for each date from January 1, 2016, to March 31, 2016.\n- `avg_num_trips` - shows the average number of daily trips, calculated over a window including the value for the current date, along with the values for the preceding 3 days and the following 3 days, as long as the days fit within the three-month time frame.  For instance, when calculating the value in this column for January 3, 2016, the window will include the number of trips for the preceding 2 days, the current date, and the following 3 days.\n\nThis query is partially completed for you, and you need only write the part that calculates the `avg_num_trips` column.  Note that this query uses a common table expression (CTE); if you need to review how to use CTEs, you're encouraged to check out [this tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/as-with) in the [Intro to SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) course.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fill in the blank below\navg_num_trips_query = \"\"\"\n                      WITH trips_by_day AS (\n                         SELECT DATE(trip_start_timestamp) AS trip_date,\n                                COUNT(*) as num_trips\n                         FROM `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`\n                         WHERE trip_start_timestamp > '2016-01-01'\n                               AND trip_start_timestamp < '2016-04-01'\n                         GROUP BY trip_date\n                         ORDER BY trip_date\n                      )\n                      SELECT trip_date,\n                             AVG(num_trips)\n                                OVER (\n                                   ORDER BY trip_date\n                                   ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 FOLLOWING\n                                ) AS avg_num_trips\n                      FROM trips_by_day\n                      \"\"\"\n\n# Check your answer\nq_1.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T13:58:52.686885Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T13:58:52.687288Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T13:58:56.132831Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T13:58:52.687255Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T13:58:56.132053Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\nq_1.hint()\nq_1.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-14T13:59:12.424340Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-14T13:59:12.424713Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-14T13:59:12.438939Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-14T13:59:12.424683Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-14T13:59:12.437835Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2) Can you separate and order trips by community area?\n\nThe query below returns a DataFrame with three columns from the table: `pickup_community_area`, `trip_start_timestamp`, and `trip_end_timestamp`.  \n\nAmend the query to return an additional column called `trip_number` which shows the order in which the trips were taken from their respective community areas.
